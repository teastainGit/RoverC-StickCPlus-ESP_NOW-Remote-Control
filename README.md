# RoverC-StickCPlus-ESP_NOW-remote-Control
 M5Stack RoverC with M5StickCPlus controlled by the IMU in a M5StackCPlus
 This Project requires 2 M5StickCPlus Controllers:
 https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/m5stickc_plus
 or the new M5StickCPlus2 controllers or a mix of either, but with suitable mods, mostly the include header:
 https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/M5StickC%20PLUS2
 Both files will require finding their MAC address and cross-linking the MAC of the ROVER to the MAC of the 'Wand'
 The MAC of one controller is input to the sketch of the other controller. Confused? yes.
